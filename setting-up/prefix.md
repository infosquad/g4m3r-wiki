# Prefix

The definition of a prefix is to add a word, letter, number or sign placed before another as an introduction.  
You put the _prefix infront of a command_, so that the bot knows you want to **use a command**.  
_For example:_ `g! help` _will let the bot know you need help._

## **How to know what the prefix of G4M3R is:**

The default prefix of G4M3R is `g!`  
To change the prefix, _which is advised if you have another bot that uses the same prefix_, follow the simple steps below.

1. Make sure you are in a channel where the bot has the **access and permissions** set up as described in [**Setting Up**](./)**.** Anyone without admin rights on the bot will not be able to get into the settings menu.
2. Access the **settings menu** of G4M3R Bot by typing `g! settings`  
   Here you can **view** the currently set prefix as shown below at **\[ 1 \]** In this case the prefix is ****\`.

3. If you want to **change** the prefix, type `1`into the chat. This will open the **prefix layer** of the menu. ![](../.gitbook/assets/serversettingsprefix.png)
4. Now you can input any _special symbol, letter or number_ to be the **new prefix** of G4M3R on \_your \_server.  
   If you want to **cancel** the action enter **C** to go back to the menu. Or **Q to quit** the menu.

   Keep in mind that you should choose a prefix which is:

   * Not commonly used to start sentences.  
   * Not used by discord itself.  
   * Not in use by any bot on your server.

   **Special symbols are usually the best option or a combination of special symbols + letters.**    
   _For example:_ ****`. * $ ! gb! < >g`

_**Tip**_: _To quick change your prefix use_ `[prefix]s prefix [newprefix]`
