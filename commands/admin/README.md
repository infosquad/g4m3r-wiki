# Admin

The following commands can only be used by **Server Bot Admins**. Server Bot Admins are the admins that you have added in the [**Settings**](settings/#2-admins) command to be Bot admins OR any person on your server that has the **Administrator Permission**.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Delete](delete.md) | The **Delete** command is a very useful command. With it you can automatically delete command messages of a specified command. |
| [Nuke](nuke.md) | The **Nuke** command is a great way to quickly clean up some channels. You can use it in multiple ways, for example delete messages from a user, delete x amount of links, delete x amount of discord links or delete x amount of your own messages. |
| [Permission](permission.md) | The **Permission** command lets you active or deactivate the usage of a specified command in a specific channel. |
| [Saverole](saverole.md) | With the **Saverole** command you can easily save roles for your discord members to self-assign roles. |
| [Settings](settings/) | The **Settings** command is one of the more complex menu's but absolutely easily accessible due to the structure. All different server settings are categorized under their own tabs which are quickly accessible through a direct command. |

To view all admin commands use: `[prefix]h admin`
