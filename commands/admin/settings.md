# Settings

Diving into customising the bot for your server. The **Settings** command is one of the more complex menu's but absolutely easily accessible due to the structure. All different server settings are categorised under their own tabs which are quickly accessible through a direct command.

## Server Settings:

_Command:_`[prefix]settings`

## \[1\] Prefix

You put the _prefix infront of a command_, so that the bot knows you want to **use a command**.  
Customising the prefix is possible in this menu. For a more detailed guide about the prefix, go [here](../../setting-up/prefix.md).

**Direct menu command:** `[prefix]s prefix`

**Direct prefix change command:** `[prefix]s prefix [newprefix].`

## \[2\] Admins

In the admins menu you can add and remove admins.  
To add an admin use: `add @mention`  
To delete an admin use: `del @mention`

Be aware that when you add an admin they can **access ALL** the server settings as well.

**Direct menu command:** `[prefix]s admins`
