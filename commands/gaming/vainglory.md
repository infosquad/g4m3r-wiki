# Vainglory

## Aliases

* Use the alias `vg` for Vainglory;
* `h` for hero;
* `m` for matches;
* `reg` for register

## Registering your account with the bot

If this is your first time checking your game stats with G4M3R, then you must first register your in-game name! There are two ways, you can do:

```text
<prefix>register vainglory
```

Or you can do:

```text
<prefix>register vainglory [YourIGN]
```

And replace **\[YourIGN\]** with your in-game name!

{% hint style="info" %}
In Vainglory, your username is cAsE sEnSiTiVe, so make sure to double-check it, or else you won't be able to view your stats.
{% endhint %}

And in case you **do** mess up your in-game name accidentally, you can just restart the process by doing the commands above again, and typing your username correctly.

## Viewing Vainglory stats

There are 3 types of stats you can view using G4M3R:

* Player stats
