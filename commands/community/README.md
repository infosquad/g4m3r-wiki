# Community

The community commands are as the name suggests focussed on the community, meaning you can share your profile in every server that has G4M3R! Everyone has their own profile which you can customize to your taste. With more than 130 backgrounds and more games than you can play that you can register to your G4M3R profile.

Find out how to customize your profile:

* [\[Accounts\]](accounts.md)
* [\[Background\]](background.md)
* [\[Events\]](events.md)
* [\[Games\]](games.md)
* [\[Profile\]](profile.md)

To view the in-chat overview of all community commands use: `[prefix]h community`
