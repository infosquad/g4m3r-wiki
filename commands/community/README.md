# Community

The community commands are as the name suggests focused on the community, meaning you can share your profile in every server that has G4M3R! Everyone has their own profile which you can customize to your taste. With more than 130 backgrounds and more games than you can play that you can register to your G4M3R profile.

Find out how to customize your profile:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Accounts](accounts.md) | The accounts command allows you to add your account names to your profile. |
| [Background](background.md) | The backgrounds command allows you to change the background of your profile. |
| [Events](events.md) | G4M3R has the best event system on Discord. It allows you to create private/public events. Private events require a password to join, which is sent to the event creator via direct message. Not only can you join/create events, you have some moderation over them. You can kick members you don't want in your event, or add members. Members can now also deny joining an event, or be added to a waiting list if the max number of members is reached. |
| [Games](games.md) | The games command allows you to add the games you play to your profile. |
| [Profile](profile.md) | The profile command allows you to view your profile or another users. |
