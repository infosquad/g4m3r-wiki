# Changelog

**v0.8.7: FEEDBACK!!!!!!!!!!!**

### Added

* **» Feedback**: Ever wanted to get suggestions or problems from your server members in a nice clean way? Ever wanted to have other users see those suggestions/Issues and vote on them? Well now you can. Feedback command allows members to send feedback to the server as a _idea_ or a _bug_. Furthermore, we also enabled sending feedback to us directly from any server using the _dev_ key.
* You can also set your own custom Emojis instead of the default emojis to represent :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown:
* You can enable or disable ideas/bugs
* You can select separate or the same channel to receive your feedback.

### Enhancements

* **»** Verification channels that are inactive for more than 10 minutes will now auto-delete. This was made for larger servers that have a lot of members joining. We love you
* **»** We realized how stupid it was to have disabled commands still appear on the help command. Now commands that are disabled will no longer appear in the general help command.
