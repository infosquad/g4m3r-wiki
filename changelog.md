# Changelog

##  **v0.8.7: FEEDBACK!!!!!!!!!!!**

### Added

* **» Feedback**: Ever wanted to get suggestions or problems from your server members in a nice clean way? Ever wanted to have other users see those suggestions/Issues and vote on them? Well now you can. Feedback command allows members to send feedback to the server as a _idea_ or a _bug_. Furthermore, we also enabled sending feedback to us directly from any server using the _dev_ key.
* You can also set your own custom Emojis instead of the default emojis to represent :thumbsup: and :thumbsdown:
* You can enable or disable ideas/bugs
* You can select separate or the same channel to receive your feedback.

### Enhancements

* **»** Verification channels that are inactive for more than 10 minutes will now auto-delete. This was made for larger servers that have a lot of members joining. We love you
* **»** We realized how stupid it was to have disabled commands still appear on the help command. Now commands that are disabled will no longer appear in the general help command.

##  **v0.8.6: Shortcuts & CAPITALS**

### Added

* **» Shortcuts**: Shortcuts are bringing in an enormous amount of awesome if you use it properly.
*  * **» CAPITAL SPAM** Slowly we are bringing back Auto-Moderation features and tuning them and making sure they are implemented perfectly without affecting the bots performance too much. The first feature will be about preventing CAPITAL SPAM. Simply go to `.settings > Moderation > Auto-Moderation >` Status to enable & Amount to set how much % is allowed. So if I set the Amount to 50, the bot will delete any message that has more than 50% capital letters.

#### Examples

* On Server: `.shortcut add news role news` What this does is simple. It adds a new shortcut to the server so anyone on the server can use it. The name of the shortcut is _news_ and is used just like any other command. **.news** is like executing **.role news**. So anyone on your server can type **.news** and get the news role.
* On DM: `.shortcut add joke meme yourajoke` This will add a new shortcut to the USER meaning this user can now use this shortcut on any server with gamer on it. Now you can send your meme easily by just typing the shortcut name.
