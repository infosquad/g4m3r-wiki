## **v0.8.8: Behind The Scenes Improvements**

This update was a necessary update that brought a lot of bug fixes and mostly updated all our dependencies to the latest technology allowing our bot to be even faster and more powerful. It also helped prepare more things to get our dashboard working. 🎉

There were no new features added in this update and it was mostly just a behind the scenes improvement on the bot.

## **v0.8.7: FEEDBACK!!!!!!!!!!!**

### Added

* **» Feedback**: Ever wanted to get suggestions or problems from your server members in a nice clean way? Ever wanted to have other users see those suggestions/Issues and vote on them? Well now you can. Feedback command allows members to send feedback to the server as a _idea_ or a _bug_. Furthermore, we also enabled sending feedback to us directly from any server using the _dev_ key.
* You can also set your own custom Emojis instead of the default emojis to represent 👍 and 👎 ❤
* You can enable or disable ideas/bugs 🎆
* You can select separate or the same channel to receive your feedback. 💃

### Enhancements

* **»** Verification channels that are inactive for more than 10 minutes will now auto-delete. This was made for larger servers that have a lot of members joining. We love you 😍
* **»** We realized how stupid it was to have disabled commands still appear on the help command. Now commands that are disabled will no longer appear in the general help command. 🎇
