# Changelog

##   **v0.8.9: Shut The Front Door!!!**

### Added Features

 **» Mute/Unmute**: Ever had someone be super annoying on your server and just wanted them to be quiet? 🤫 The mute feature when activated from the settings command allow you to create and set up two muted roles which can be used to mute users separately. You can mute them on voice only, text only, or both text and voice\(default\). We also created a separate command `.tmute` to mute a user for a certain amount of time and the bot will automatically `.unmute` them when the time is up.

### Enhancements and/or Bug Fixes

 **» Vainglory commands** got a massive overhaul. Not only do you now have reactions to go to different commands from one to another but also we added in a lot more emojis! ❤  Check it out with `.vg`.  You can tap the reactions to see your detailed info. 💃  Vaing   lory commands also got a performance boost and are now processing almost 150% faster! ⚡ 

 **» Kitten command** now gives really cool amazing kitten facts along with the image/gif. 🐱



## **v0.8.8: Behind The Scenes Improvements**

This update was a necessary update that brought a lot of bug fixes and mostly updated all our dependencies to the latest technology allowing our bot to be even faster and more powerful. It also helped prepare more things to get our dashboard working. 🎉

There were no new features added in this update and it was mostly just a behind the scenes improvement on the bot. 🎆💃

## **v0.8.7: FEEDBACK!!!!!!!!!!!**

### Added Features

* **» Feedback**: Ever wanted to get suggestions or problems from your server members in a nice clean way? Ever wanted to have other users see those suggestions/Issues and vote on them? Well now you can. Feedback command allows members to send feedback to the server as a _idea_ or a _bug_. Furthermore, we also enabled sending feedback to us directly from any server using the _dev_ key.
* You can also set your own custom Emojis instead of the default emojis to represent 👍 and 👎 ❤
* You can enable or disable ideas/bugs 🎆
* You can select separate or the same channel to receive your feedback. 💃

### Enhancements and/or Bug Fixes

* **» Verification channels** that are inactive for more than 10 minutes will now auto-delete. This was made for larger servers that have a lot of members joining. We love you 😍
* **»** We realized how stupid it was to have disabled commands still appear on the help command. Now commands that are disabled will no longer appear in the general help command. 🎇
